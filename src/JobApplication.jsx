                    <p>We need a React designer to quickly convert this nonfunctional design to working code for another developer to finish it. We want the chat functionality to work with local data, someone else will connect the API. However, we should see additional chats added like it would normally. We used a plugin to generate the code, so something may need to get cleaned up so it can be proper for another developer to finish working. We need someone who can work quick! We have a 4 hours turn around needed. This could turn into more work. To get an interview, explain what you have to do in your own words.</p>
